ETCH-A-SKETCH is a HTML, CSS, and Javascript project created by Bret Rivera during The Odin Project curriculum. My goal for this assignment was to meet the main goals of the assignment while adding extra functionality to show growth over the course of the project.

The goal of the assignment is as such: Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. When the divs are hovered over by the mouse, they will change color and leave a 'trail' creating an effect similar to an etch-a-sketch toy. Buttons will be used to clear the grid and bring a popup asking how many buttons to put in each column.

Extra functions include: random color trails, gradiants.

It took approximately 10 hours to finish this project.
